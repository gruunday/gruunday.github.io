Fatastic addition to motd to give users an idea of how much storage they are using when connecting via ssh Panoptes source A hardware project to add distributed wifi monitoring with cheap hardware to a campus. Can draw network maps with genetic algorithms. CURART source A project to index images and find duplicate image with SIFT and SURF algorithms.
